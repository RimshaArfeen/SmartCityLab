    details: "The use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based physical sensors to perceive the environment is a prevalent and global approach. However, one major problem is the reliability of physical sensors' nodes, which creates difficulty in a real-time system to identify whether the physical sensor is transmitting correct values or malfunctioning due to external disturbances affecting the system, such as noise. In this paper, the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural networks is proposed as an alternate approach to address this problem. The proposed solution is tested for a smart irrigation system, where a physical sensor is replaced by a neural sensor. The Smart Irrigation System (SIS) contains several physical sensors, which transmit temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data to calculate the transpiration in a particular field. The real-world values are taken from an agriculture field, located in a field of lemons near the Ghadap Sindh province of Pakistan. The LM35 sensor is used for temperature, DHT-22 for humidity, and we designed a customized sensor in our lab for the acquisition of moisture values. The results of the experiment show that the proposed deep learning-based neural sensor predicts the real-time values with high accuracy, especially the temperature values. The humidity and moisture values are also in an acceptable range. Our results highlight the possibility of using a neural network, referred to as a neural sensor here, to complement the functioning of a physical sensor deployed in an agriculture field in order to make smart irrigation systems more reliable.",

     details:"Over recent years, the demand for supplies of freshwater is escalating with the increasing food demand of a fast-growing population. The agriculture sector of Pakistan contributes to 26% of its GDP and employs 43% of the entire labor force. However, the currently used traditional farming methods such as flood irrigation and rotating water allocation system (Warabandi) results in excess and untimely water usage, as well as low crop yield. Internet of things (IoT) solutions based on real-time farm sensor data and intelligent decision support systems have led to many smart farming solutions, thus improving water utilization. The objective of this study was to compare and optimize water usage in a 2-acre lemon farm test site in Gadap, Karachi, for a 9-month duration, by deploying an indigenously developed IoT device and an agriculture-based decision support system (DSS). The sensor data are wirelessly collected over the cloud, a mobile application, and a web-based information visualization, and a DSS system makes irrigation recommendations. The DSS system is based on weather data (temperature and humidity), real-time in situ sensor data from the IoT device deployed in the farm, and crop data (Kc and crop type). These data are supplied to the Penman–Monteith and crop coefficient model to make recommendations for irrigation schedules in the test site. The results show impressive water savings (~50%) combined with increased yield (35%) when compared with water usage and crop yields in a neighboring 2-acre lemon farm where traditional irrigation scheduling was employed and where harsh conditions sometimes resulted in temperatures in excess of 50°C.",

    details: "Weed management is becoming increasingly important for sustainable crop production. Weeds cause an average yield loss of 11.5% billion in Pakistan, which is more than PKR 65 billion per year. A real-time laser weeding robot can increase the crop’s yield by efficiently removing weeds. Therefore, it helps decrease the environmental risks associated with traditional weed management approaches. However, to work efficiently and accurately, the weeding robot must have a robust weed detection mechanism to avoid physical damage to the targeted crops. This work focuses on developing a lightweight weed detection mechanism to assist laser weeding robots. The weed images were collected from six different agriculture farms in Pakistan. The dataset consisted of 9000 images of three crops: okra, bitter gourd, sponge gourd, and four weed species (horseweed, herb paris, grasses, and small weeds). We chose a single-shot object detection model, YOLO5. The selected model achieved a mAP of 0.88@IOU 0.5, indicating that the model predicted a large number of true positive (TP) with much less prediction of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN). While SSD-ResNet50 achieved a mAP of 0.53@IOU 0.5, the model predicted fewer TP with significant outcomes as FP or FN. The superior performance of the YOLOv5 model made it suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops within fields. Furthermore, the model was ported to an Nvidia Xavier AGX standalone device to make it a high-performance and low-power computation detection system. The model achieved an FPS rate of 27. Therefore, it is highly compatible with the laser weeding robot, which takes approximately 22.04 h at a velocity of 0.25 feet per second to remove weeds from a one-acre plot.",

    details: "The management of the abundant amount of used plastic bottle waste is a major concern nowadays, because it is a major contributor to landfills and overburdens waste processing facilities. Once disposed of, plastic can take centuries to break down, hence, recycling not only manages the waste efficiently, but it reduces the environmental impact and creates economic opportunities, as well. An incentive-based Reverse Vending machine (RVM) is an effective way to involve the general public in the management of plastic waste. The existing solutions are either very expensive, from a computation and cost perspective, or they lack the robustness and durability necessary for deployment. In this research, we have developed an incentive-based low-cost RVM for the collection, identification, classification, and sorting of used plastic bottles with the addition of a reward-based user application. The developed RVM includes a low-cost computing device running a lightweight image processing algorithm, sensors, camera, and a self-designed mechanical arm. To support the low computing device in the RVM, a lightweight MobileNet model has been trained using transfer learning. A dataset of 10,983 pet bottle images was collected using a camera installed inside the machine for the classification model. The results of the study show that MobileNet achieved 99.2% testing accuracy, which is better than the existing bottle-classification approaches. Moreover, the weight of the developed model was only 12 Mb, which is fourteen and six times less than inceptionV3 and Res-Net (Residual Neural Networks), respectively. Furthermore, the developed RVM costs a fraction of the price, compared to the existing solutions. Two versions of the machine have been deployed at a University for more than 6 months, collecting over 650 kg of plastic waste.",

The objective of the study is to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a social media-based communication strategy in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. The leadership of the pediatric service line developed an intervention plan to engage the employees with the newly reframed vision to improve patient and family experience. An online communication platform—Facebook page—was created for all employees of the pediatric service line. The strategy to influence employees was based on Cialdini's six principles of persuasion. Implementation of the strategy between October 2017 and December 2019 was evaluated for reach, discussion themes, and outcomes using the framework by Murdough (2009). Quantitative indicators included total posts, mean comments, and reactions per post. Posts were qualitatively analyzed with an emergent approach for insights into the discussion. The analysis revealed a total of 9,085 posts, with mean reactions per post of 8.4, mean comments of 7.2, and active viewership by 90% members on average. In terms of post types, photos were the highest (4,779), while videos were the lowest (1,163). Qualitative analysis indicated 54% of the posts were of the theme 'inspirational and thought provoking,' while the greatest engagement was generated on the theme 'challenges and solution.' The authors conclude that the strategy was successfully implemented to maintain active membership, engage employees in meaningful conversations, and have them express intent to execute quality improvement projects.",

While making an offloading decision, in user-centric offloading schemes, the network context is not taken into account, which limits the full utilization of the potential offered by these techniques. Therefore, in this work, we develop a data offloading framework wherein a user defines a tuple, which includes a request for data service and the associated delay limit, and the user equipment (UE) translates this tuple into an optimal offloading policy by taking into account the network context. The data offloading problem is formulated by assuming a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP), and an analytical data offloading model is derived by using stochastic geometry for modeling the spatial domain of a multi-RAT wireless network, and by employing Markov process for capturing mobility of users. In order to validate the performance of derived model, we also solve the offloading problem by using policy iteration (PI) algorithm. The results show that the analytical algorithm outperforms the iterative algorithm. We also benchmark the proposed framework against standard data offloading methods.",

This paper develops a unified framework for signal‐to‐interference‐plus‐noise ratio and rate coverage analysis of multi‐RAT HetNets, with each RAT employing either a contention‐free or a contention‐based channel access strategy. The proposed framework adopts tools from stochastic geometry, with the location of APs and mobile users modeled through independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). We specifically focus on a two‐RAT scenario (i.e., cellular and Wi‐Fi), where for multi‐tier Wi‐Fi RAT, with contention‐based channel access like CSMA/CA, the location dependent distribution of interfering APs has been approximated through a homogeneous PPP. Moreover, by using some simple yet realistic set of assumptions, the distance to nearest active AP has been defined which results in simplified expressions. The medium access probability for a random and a tagged AP under a multi-tier Wi-Fi RAT has also been derived and discussed. By keeping in view the tremendous effect of temporal domain on overall network performance, the stable queue probability has been derived by assuming a non-saturated traffic model. The results have been validated through extensive simulations and compared with existing approaches. Some useful insights have also been presented that shed light on design and analysis of multi-RAT HetNets and provide motivation for further research in this direction.",

    title: "Autonomous modulation classification using single inception module based convolutional neural network",
    authors: ["Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz", "Muhammad Khurram", "Muhammad Adnan", "Adnan Fazil"],
    details: "Modulation recognition plays a crucial role in noncooperative communication in which receivers have no prior information regarding transmitter modulation scheme. This paper presents a novel convolutional neural network with single Stem and Inception module for autonomous modulation classification from raw I/Q received channels. This addresses the computationally intensive problem of conversion of I/Q channels to constellation image processing. The proposed system is capable of classifying 11 standard modulation schemes with both 2D and 3D input array configurations for varying SNR conditions. The performance of proposed system has been evaluated for a real-time communication system simulated with Rician fading channel and AWGN noise model, providing realistic distortion effects. The proposed CNN design achieves an average accuracy of 90% at 10 dB and 99% at 20 dB SNR with reduced network learnables and lower training and testing time, which makes it computationally efficient.",

    title: "Optimal overhead energy efficient algorithm of Leach protocol in wireless sensor networks",
    authors: ["K Muhammad", "P Sellappan", "I Syed"],
    details: "Future world will consist of smart devices that would basically depend upon the sensory data from real world environments. In this way, the inevitability of large scale remote sensors and IoT is unyielding in the future. Wireless sensor nodes have limited resources, which comprised of spatially dispersed remote sensing nodes, which have some constrained issues among them the consumption of the power is the most significant one. WSN consumes hundreds to thousand times more energy in transmission of data as compared to the execution of instructions. The applications of the WSN are in widespread fields, e.g., Military battlefield, detection of forest fire, medical, and smart home/city automations. So a big challenge for researchers for a large scale WSNs during the collection of data is the minimal amount of energy utilization. A lot of techniques used to diminish the utilization of energy in data gathering. Among all, small size data packets is one of the important aspects to conserve energy, because sensor node dissipates less amount of power for information processing as compared to communication among the nodes. Reduce energy consumption and decreases the system delay is the prime target of cluster-based sensor networks. For micro-sensor networks, LEACH is a cluster-based protocol that accomplishes low power, expandable routing and reasonable access of media for sensing nodes. Data collection with usage of a dynamic clustering method is possible in different rounds. In every round, a new set of clusters with different nodes comes into existence. The basic concept of LEACH is optimal set of CH.",

    authors: ["H Sundus Fatima", "Ammar N Abbas", "Faraz Bawany", "Huma Zia", "Syed Adnan Yusuf", "Muhammad Khurram"],
    details: "Autonomous vehicles (AV) have garnered significant interest in recent years due to its potential for controlling thousands of accidents that happen yearly due to human error. However, AV bring with it very complex and sophisticated requirements and challenges related to extensive testing of the algorithms and hardware in the physical world. The evolution of automotive simulation tools provides an opportunity to fully test and validate AV architectures without the risk of creating hazardous situations in real world. This research demonstrates the application of HD (High Definition) maps in autonomous vehicle navigation using ROS interface integrated with the CARLA (CAR Learning to Act) simulator. The sensor data includes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), RGB-Depth (RGB-D), and vehicle odometry. HD maps play an important role in robustness of the autonomous systems where due to sensor obstruction or weather conditions the vehicle is unable to perceive the information ahead.",

    authors: ["Imtiaz Ul Hassan", "Huma Zia", "H Sundus Fatima", "Syed Adnan Yusuf", "Muhammad Khurram"],
    details: "End‐to‐end learning for autonomous driving uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the steering angle from a raw image input. Most of the solutions available for end‐to‐end autonomous driving are computationally too expensive, which increases the inference of autonomous driving in real time. Therefore, in this paper, CNN architecture has been trained which is lightweight and achieves comparable results to Nvidia’s PilotNet. The data used to train and evaluate the network is collected from the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the MSE (mean squared error) is used as the performance metric. Results of the experiment shows that the proposed model is 4x lighter than Nvidia’s PilotNet in term of parameters but still attains comparable results to PilotNet. The proposed model has achieved 5.1 × 10−4 MSE on testing data while PilotNet MSE was 4.7 × 10−4.",

    authors: ["Hafiza Sundus Fatima", "Laeeq Uz Zaman", "Huma Zia", "Muhammad Khurram"],
    details: "Locating a dynamic object in an industrial environment in real time has been a significant scientific problem. The precise localization and positioning of an object are achieved by Satellite communication, Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), Bluetooth technologies, etc. The use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been a success for locating an object in an outdoor environment, but indoor positioning has been impractical when using this technology. A good option is to utilize short-range Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology with Time of Flight, Time Difference of Arrival, and Phase difference of Arrival methods for precise ranging applications. In this research paper, we presented an accurate indoor positioning system using a UWB radio-based embedded system. The system deployed multiple fixed positioning stations called anchors, programmed to detect the position of the dynamic object. The presented system in this paper calculates the object position by using the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method and the triangulation method. The Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is found to effectively locate the dynamic object in three-dimensional space within an error rate of +/−0.07 m.",

    authors: ["Murk Marvi", "Adnan Aijaz", "Anam Qureshi", "Muhammad Khurram"],
    details: "Data offloading is considered as a potential candidate for alleviating congestion on wireless networks and for improving user experience. However, due to the stochastic nature of the wireless networks, it is important to take optimal actions under different conditions such that the user experience is enhanced and congestion on heavy‐loaded radio access technologies (RATs) is reduced by offloading data through lower loaded RATs. Since artificial intelligence (AI)‐based techniques can learn optimal actions and adapt to different conditions, in this work, we develop an AI‐enabled Q‐agent for making data offloading decisions in a multi‐RAT wireless network. We employ a model‐free Q‐learning algorithm for training of the Q‐agent. We use stochastic geometry as a tool for estimating the average data rate offered by the network in a given region by considering the effect of interference.",

    details: "Crowd monitoring and analysis is an extremely focused area for visual surveillance and management of crowded events. A crowd counting method in densely crowded situations has been presented in this paper. The developed technique detects people and counts them in a massive dense crowd based on head region detection using a single aerial snap. Gaussian mixture model (an unsupervised machine learning technique) was employed to train the intelligent system for foreground detection (head) to obtain authentic segmentation outcomes. Further, by using blob analysis the numbers of people were estimated in the crowd. The approach is tested on different types of images and analysed in variety of situations with the head counts up to four thousand five hundred sixty three. The results showed accuracy up to ninety percent under different environmental conditions.",
