//       description: "Smart Irrigation System is the latest IoT technology which is helpful and leads to ease of farming. The engineers at the Smart City Lab have developed IoT devices that will improve the process of Smart Irrigation. Approximately 70% of the water withdrawn from various freshwater sources is used for agricultural activities. A majority of this water is wasted due to overwatering caused by inefficiencies in traditional irrigation methods and systems. Adopting smart irrigation is the best solution. This system monitors soil conditions and plant water use. By using this smart irrigation concept, we can bring back the greenery that is vanishing due to rapid urbanization. The system will help farmers achieve good yields.",

//       description: "Water Resource Management focuses on using IoT-based irrigation systems to bridge the gap between water usage and maximizing crop yield. The main objective is to design an expert system to automate the process of estimating water supply to the fields. This study includes implementing an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) that utilizes AI techniques to minimize water usage while maintaining crop yield. The system is vital for areas with limited water supply, such as Sindh, where agriculture is the foundation of the economy.",
