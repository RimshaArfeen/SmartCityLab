The engineers at the Smart City Lab have developed IoT devices that will improve the process of Smart Irrigation. Approximately 70% of the water withdrawn from various freshwater sources is used for agricultural activities. A majority of this water is wasted due to overwatering caused by inefficiencies in traditional irrigation methods and systems. Adopting smart irrigation is the best solution. This system monitors soil conditions and plant water use. By using this smart irrigation concept, we can bring back the greenery that is vanishing due to rapid urbanization. The system will help farmers achieve good yields.",
